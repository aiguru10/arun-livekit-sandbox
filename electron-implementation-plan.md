# Iterative Implementation Plan: React to Electron (macOS)

## Overview
Convert the existing React LiveKit voice agent app into a native macOS Electron application while maintaining all functionality.

## Iteration 1: Basic Electron Shell (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Get Electron running with the React app

**Steps**:
1. Add Electron dependencies
2. Create basic `main.js` 
3. Create `preload.js` for security
4. Update package.json scripts
5. Test: Electron window opens with React app

**Success Criteria**: Electron app launches and displays the React interface

---

## Iteration 2: Static Export Setup (45 minutes)
**Goal**: Convert Next.js to work without server-side features

**Steps**:
1. Configure Next.js for static export
2. Handle the API route conversion (connection-details)
3. Update build process
4. Test: App works in Electron without Next.js server

**Success Criteria**: App loads completely in Electron, no server dependencies

---

## Iteration 3: Environment Variables & Security (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Securely handle LiveKit credentials

**Steps**:
1. Move credentials from `.env.local` to Electron secure storage
2. Set up IPC for credential access
3. Update React app to get credentials via IPC
4. Test: App connects to LiveKit successfully

**Success Criteria**: LiveKit connection works with secure credential storage

---

## Iteration 4: Media Permissions & WebRTC (20 minutes)
**Goal**: Ensure audio/video works properly in Electron

**Steps**:
1. Configure Electron permissions for microphone/camera
2. Test media access
3. Verify LiveKit audio/video functionality

**Success Criteria**: Voice agent interaction works identically to web version

---

## Iteration 5: macOS App Packaging (45 minutes)
**Goal**: Create distributable macOS app

**Steps**:
1. Add electron-builder configuration
2. Configure macOS-specific settings (icons, app name)
3. Build .dmg installer
4. Test installation and app launch

**Success Criteria**: Installable .dmg file that runs on macOS

---

## Iteration 6: Polish & Distribution (30 minutes)
**Goal**: Production-ready macOS app

**Steps**:
1. Add app icon and metadata
2. Configure auto-updater (basic)
3. Add error handling
4. Final testing

**Success Criteria**: Professional macOS app ready for distribution

---

## Summary
- **Total Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
- **Testing Points**: After each iteration, the app should remain functional
- **Rollback Strategy**: Each iteration builds on the previous, easy to revert
- **Target Platform**: macOS only
- **Final Output**: Installable .dmg file with native macOS app

## Technical Notes
- Maintains all existing LiveKit functionality
- Secure credential storage
- Native macOS integration
- No server dependencies in final app
- WebRTC and media access preserved
